# Introduction

Accessing AI has never been easier than it is today - this site is here to help you get started, both for the novice and the eager coder. This is, however, mainly an introduction and a way to get started - there's plenty of resources available if you have already started using AI.

# Easiest to use - online general AI

## [ChatGPT](https://chatgpt.com/) 

OpenAI's ChatGPT is likely the most well known and easily accessible AI. It has the advantage of being meant for natural language use, so you can literally just chat away with it and ask it to do things for you, and it will most likely work.

It is also very capable, and can process text in various ways (and generate images if logged in), and doesn't require a login/account to use (although free use will be restricted in some ways).

## [Copilot](https://copilot.microsoft.com)

Microsoft's Copilot is similar to ChatGPT, having free access to text processing but requires an account to do image processing. It's currently considered to be slightly less capable than ChatGPT, but do have a lot of code-based knowledge thanks to Microsoft's purchase of GitHub.

## [DeepSeek](https://chat.deepseek.com/)

New challenger to ChatGPT from a Chinese firm. Astoundingly powerful in spite of not allegedly not having the huge budget that ChatGPT has had.

NOTE: *Requires* registration, but not payment.

# Online specialized AI

## [Claude](https://claude.ai/)

Claude is meant to help with software development assistance, and has an interface that reflects that (being better at handling a workspace with several files etc).

Can be used for adjacent tasks - for instance to create an HTML presentation, including populating the content. It is good at creating new projects from natural language, but can not be used to edit a project forever - it will eventually run out of 'memory' (or tokens, as it's called in the AI world).

NOTE: *Requires* registration, but not payment.

## [Cursor](https://www.cursor.com)

Another AI that is intended to help with software development, and is more of an auto-complete and analysis tool than a natural language project maker.

NOTE: *Requires* registration, but not payment - free account is time limited.

# Local AI

## [LM Studio](https://lmstudio.ai/)

LM Studio is an easy way to get started with running AI on your local computer - just go to the site and install the program, choose the default (pretty small) model and then start typing away to it.

Do note that a local AI tends to require a lot more care and feeding than the online versions, but has the advantage of allowing you full control of what you request out of it.

NOTE: Entirely free, and no data leaks out from your computer.

## [Fooocus](https://github.com/lllyasviel/Fooocus?tab=readme-ov-file#download)

Local image generation with a simple web-based UI. The prompt to generate images is more technical, a bit fiddly and less natural than using the online general AI tools; the benefit being better control over the actual prompt and being able to manipulate the tools directly using e.g. image prompts or LoRA:s.

NOTE: Entirely free. Can result in NSFW images.

## Python installation

For the refined developer who's willing to invest time and effort.
